 What do you think about RFK Jr? I knew Bobby a little bit before he ran when he
was an environmental lawyer. His legal work is excellent. He's been on the right
side of most of the issues for most of his life. I like him for all the things
that he did positive, holding fossil fuel companies accountable, protecting
communities that had poison dumped into rivers, etc. Right? So the thing that
affects everybody is when he gets like corporate media smeared the hell out of
them and They didn't allow them to speak whenever it's an insider They find the
best parts of their lives and then they Amplify so Joe Biden is average Joe from
Scranton Motherf-in-in DC for the last 52 years. You think we don't have eyes
and ears Okay, like average Joe from Scranton, who are you kidding? See, that's
the theater of politics. But if you're an outsider and they don't like you, then
they're going to look at the haystack of your life and they're going to try to
find needles.
