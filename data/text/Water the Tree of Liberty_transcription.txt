 In 2013, there was a poll where they asked young Americans under the age of 35,
are you proud to be an American? 85% said yes. The same poll taken six months
ago, 17% said yes. We have a whole generation that's lost their pride in being
an American citizen and they've lost hope for their own futures. And we had a
generation in 1776, 20,000 of them died. a huge number, there'll be like a
million people today to give us our Constitution. They said to us that every
generation must water the Tree of Liberty with its own blood if you're gonna
hold on to this. So, it's not something that I wanted to, I have a really good
life and I had a great family that loved me, I still have a nuclear family that
loves me. But, and I have a big, big family now too. You know, I didn't feel
like I had a choice. I felt like I have to do this the same reason. People left
their homes in 1776 to do something for an idea and I wanna keep that idea for
my kids. you
